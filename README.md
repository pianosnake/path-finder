This app tries to find the easiest hike from one point to another in a landscape. It's a JavaScript implementation using HTML5 canvas and A* with binary heaps to find the easiest path.

Click the landscape to set a start point, click it again to set an end point. The path will be drawn in red.

To run locally, first get the dependencies with Bower (`bower install`) and then open index.html.
