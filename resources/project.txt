Used the algo to predict historical path native americans took.  But people make errors in estimating slopes and distances, leading to sub-optimal choices. 

Use it to predict an east-to-west route across the continent. Find ways to measure discrepancies between predicted trails and actual trails.   Find missing persons with it by predicting the likely route they would take. 

Differences in path based on how pixels are latticed to make a network.  Orthogonal, diagonal, or knight (L-shapes). 

Going downhill on steep slopes is more dangerous than goin uphill on the same slope

Roads on mountain passes rarely exceed 5 degrees (9%) Rails are even more constricted to 1.9 degrees (3.3 %). 

Does a switchback exist on a virgin slope? Or is it like a tunnel or a bridge?

Showed that the models of  Least Cost DEM were a poor predictor of prehistoric routes in the dessert of California.

Cost formula (Naismith's Rule).  Metabolic cost of walking different slopes.
